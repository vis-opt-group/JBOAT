**JBOAT** is a compositional **O**per**A**tion-level **T**oolbox for gradient-based **B**LO.
Unlike existing libraries that typically encapsulate fixed solver routines, JBOAT factorizes the BLO workflow into **atomic, reusable primitives**. Through a unified constraint reconstruction perspective, it empowers researchers to **automatically compose** over **85+ solver variants** from a compact set of **17 gradient operations**.


JBOAT is designed to offer robust computational support for a broad spectrum of BLO research and applications, enabling innovation and efficiency in machine learning and computer vision.


## 🔑 Key Features

* **🧩 Compositional Operation-Level Abstraction**: Deconstructs BLO solvers into three modular stages: *Gradient Mapping (GM)*, *Numerical Approximation (NA)*, and *First-Order (FO)*.
* **⚡ Accelerated JIT Execution**: Built on Jittor, enabling meta-operator fusion and high-performance execution on NVIDIA GPUs.
* **🏭 Generative Solver Construction**: Supports dynamic serialization of operations. Users can recover classical algorithms or discover **novel hybrid solvers** simply by changing configurations.
* **🛠 Configuration-Driven**: Define complex optimization strategies via simple `JSON` configurations, decoupling algorithmic logic from model definitions.
* **✅ Comprehensive Testing**: Achieves **99% code coverage** through rigorous testing with **pytest**, ensuring software robustness.

##  🚀 **Why JBOAT?**
Existing automatic differentiation (AD) tools primarily focus on specific optimization strategies, such as explicit or implicit methods, and are often targeted at meta-learning or specific application scenarios, lacking support for algorithm customization. 

In contrast, **JBOAT** expands the landscape of Bi-Level Optimization (BLO) applications by supporting a broader range of problem-adaptive operations. It bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical deployment, offering unparalleled flexibility to design, customize, and accelerate BLO techniques.


## 🌍 Applications

JBOAT covers a wide spectrum of BLO applications, categorized by the optimization target:

* **Data-Centric**: Data Hyper-Cleaning, Synthetic Data Reweighting, Diffusion Model Guidance.
* **Model-Centric**: Neural Architecture Search (NAS), LLM Prompt Optimization, Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT).
* **Strategy-Centric**: Meta-Learning, Hyperparameter Optimization (HO), Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF).
