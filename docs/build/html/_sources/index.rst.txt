Welcome to JBOAT Documentation
============================================

**BOAT** is a compositional, gradient-based **Bi-Level Optimization (BLO)** Python library that abstracts BLO into modular and flexible components, enabling efficient modeling of hierarchical and nested learning problems. It supports a wide spectrum of optimization settings, including first- and second-order methods, nested or non-nested formulations, with or without theoretical guarantees. This repository provides the **Jittor-based** implementation (jboat), leveraging Jittor’s JIT compilation and efficient CUDA/cuDNN backends to accelerate large-scale gradient-based BLO experiments.
